UK SCHOOL FUNDING PROJECT

This was a research paper that I wrote as part of my MSc. in Data Science with the International University of Applied Sciences. 

The purpose of the study was to use python and its supporting libraries to analyse the existing funding formula used by the UK's Department of Education to allocate funds to schools. It looked at results from the multiplication times table check that year 4 students complete every year. As a national test this allowed me to compare the results in the test to the funds spent by schools on various categories, such as staff salaries.
